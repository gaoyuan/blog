Just another [post](http://www.google.com/ "Google").

> "There's no need to adjust your browser or change your eyeglasses. If the first paragraph, above, appears greek to you -- you aren't seeing things. It's an example of greeked text used by desktop publishers and others for years. The Lorem ipsum text is a series of somewhat nonsense sentences derived from some actual Latin components. It is also referred to as placeholder or dummy text. The purpose?"

* In Templates
Use as placeholder text in templates if there is no placeholder text already in place.
Initial Layouts
Use during initial page layout and font selection exercises when first starting a design project or when planning a newsletter or Web page when you don't have the actual copy available.

* Testing Type & Layout

Use with various fonts and layouts to get a feel for how each type choice and design will look with real text. The word lengths and letters are similar to the actual frequency of letters in English which makes it good for approximating any text.

* Samples
Use when creating examples of document designs for clients, students. [including Web pages]
Type Specimen Sheets

Use when creating type specimen sheets or examples from which you or clients choose fonts for a project.

You could cut and paste the first paragraph of this article over and over, or download one of the Lorem ipsum text files I created. The first is simply 3 variations of the same paragraph repeated over and over. The second is 10 unique paragraphs of varying length. Right click (PC) or click/hold (Mac) on the link then save the plain text file to your hard drive. Or click on the link and choose "Save" in your browser. See the links at the end of this article for more variations on the lorem ipsum placeholder text.
