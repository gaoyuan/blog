Today I talked with Professor Mark Kot about my progress in the marathon of PhD. Mark was very helpful and offered me lots of advice. I'm about to take my general exam this year, so it's important to keep in mind the rules.

Both the general exam and the final thesis defense are supervised by a committee of four to five professors. Chairman of the committee, of course, is my advisor. One of them is the Graduate School Representative (GPA), and he/she has to be from another department. The main purpose of GPA is to keep my advisor from answering questions for me, thus maintaining the fairness of the exam. Aside from the chairman and GPA, one of the professors must be from the CORE amath faculty. That's basically all the constraints, so I have the freedom to choose one or two other committee members. And it's always a good idea to choose professors knowledgeable of the field of my research.

For the final thesis defense, I have to get my written thesis proofread by the reading committee, which are formed by two members from my supervisory committee, before formally arranging an exam date with the graduate school. One important thing to remind my advisor to bring on the final exam is the warrant, a document that has to be signed by all members.
